- ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ Hi, I’m @evelynbbo, have been teaching secondary math for 10 years
- 👀🙏 I’m interested in learning to code, create tests, run tests for software (really hoping for career switch to transfer my current skills, further explore and strenghten my potentials)
- 🌱👶 I have ZERO knowledge/experience in coding, no friends or relatives in the field either. I’m currently learning SQL through Google online course. 
- 📫 Please don't hesitate to help... thank you so much
